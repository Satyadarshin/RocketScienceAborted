                <p>I&rsquo;m a Bristol-based creative professional &mdash; an artist-illustrator, all round Web developer, and graphic designer &mdash; in process of acquiring a full-stack, Front-end skill base. <a href="https://www.satyadarshin.com/">Check out my portfolio site.</a></p>
                <p>This is a sandox page that takes some arbitrary data (winners of SF literary prizes) and processes it into a flexible table structure.</p>

            <h2>About the project</h2>
            <p>All of the output you see here was written in modern HTML, CSS, and vanilla (ES6) javaScript as far as practicable. It&rsquo;s an open-ended project, the purpose of which is to add little problems for no other reason than to solve them.</p>            
            <p>The project was developed for Firefox and makes zero concessions to broader browser support (I make no attempt to support Internet Explorer). Clearly this isn&rsquo;t acceptable in a production project, but to emphasise, this is a self-training sandbox, so if something doesn&rsquo;t work, or looks clumsy, that&rsquo;s within project scope.</p>
            <h3 class="about-subtitle">About the data</h3>
            <div class="about-text">
                <p>Because this is a training project, I&rsquo;ve restricted myself to browser-native JavaScript. The award lists are stored as regular JSON files, not in a database.</p>
